# Wordsearcher

A word search solver written in Rust.

## Usage

Use -g to specify a path to a text file with the grid, and -w for a path to the words. Note, the grid has to have each line separated by a new line character, and the words file has to have each word on a new line as well.

The word search is case sensitive!
